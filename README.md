# Automated_README

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to get more familiar with back-end development. Specifically, working with inquirer and node.js. This application creates a custom README based on the users input, making creating a README a much faster and easier task. This was an interesting assignment as it displayed the usefullness of node.js. I also learned how to get more familiar wth documentation during this assignment.
